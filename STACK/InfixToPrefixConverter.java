To convert an infix expression to a prefix expression, you can follow these rules and steps:

Rules:

Operators have precedence levels, with higher precedence operators taking precedence over lower precedence operators.
Infix expressions may have parentheses to indicate the order of evaluation. Operators inside parentheses are evaluated first.
Operators may be left-associative (e.g., +, -, *, /) or right-associative (e.g., ^ for exponentiation).
Steps:

Reverse the infix expression to obtain its reverse (right-to-left) form.

Initialize an empty stack to hold operators.

Initialize an empty string or StringBuilder to store the prefix expression.

Scan the reversed infix expression from left to right (now effectively right to left).

For each character in the reversed expression:

If it is an operand (a letter or digit), append it to the prefix expression.
If it is an operator:
If the stack is empty, push the operator onto the stack.
If the stack is not empty:
If the operator has higher precedence than the operator at the top of the stack, push it onto the stack.
If the operator has the same precedence as the operator at the top of the stack:
If the operator is left-associative, push it onto the stack.
If the operator is right-associative, pop operators from the stack and append them to the prefix expression until an operator with lower precedence or an opening parenthesis is encountered. Then push the current operator onto the stack.
If the operator has lower precedence than the operator at the top of the stack, pop operators from the stack and append them to the prefix expression until an operator with lower precedence or an opening parenthesis is encountered. Then push the current operator onto the stack.
If it is an opening parenthesis '(', push it onto the stack.
If it is a closing parenthesis ')', pop operators from the stack and append them to the prefix expression until an opening parenthesis '(' is encountered. Pop and discard the opening parenthesis.
After processing all characters, pop any remaining operators from the stack and append them to the prefix expression.

Reverse the prefix expression to obtain the final prefix notation.
